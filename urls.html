        <h4>What is a URL?</h4>
        <p>
          URL stands for uniform resource locator, and on a website the URL is
          the specific location of a video, file, page, etc. on the internet.
          Sir Tim Berners-Lee was accredited with the coinage of this term, and
          in 1994 the URL was suggested a standard by Lee. Interestingly, URLs
          were created based on the concept of hypertext, a term coined by
          Theodore Holm Nelson in 1963, where information or specific parts in a
          website/piece of text were linked to others.

          <h4>Components of a URL and what do they do?:</h4> A URL comprises of three
          parts: the protocol, domain name, and finally, path. At the beginning
          of a URL, there is the *protocol.* On most websites, this would be the
          HTTP, HHTPS or even the less common FTP. The protocol formats the
          information (data) it receives into something understandable and
          meaningful, thus telling the browser how to communicate with a
          website’s server, in order to send a retrieve information. Followed by
          this is the *domain name*. This is the identifier for a specific site,
          and usually brings you to the home page if no path is added on. The
          domain name usually ends with a top level domain (TLD) for example,
          .com, .org, .co.za, etc. When you enter the domain name in your web
          browser, the servers on the domain name system (DNS) lookup name
          servers associated with the domain. When your request reaches the web
          server, it fetches the web page along with pieces of information
          associated with it. The domain name can also begin with xn. This
          indicates that the original characters were changed into a domain name
          compatible with the DNS Finally, at the end is the *path* (as known as
          the URL slug). Each page or file on a website has it’s own path, and
          this part of the URL takes you directly to that information. Paths
          comprise of many symbols which indicate various things: A forward
          slash indicates a subfolder, A question mark indicates a query by the
          user, and multiple queries are separated by ampersands, A hashtag
          indicates a specific place on a website You may also find that there
          is percent encoding in the path. This means that the original
          characters have been changed. For example, a $ sign will change to
          %24.

          <h4>Thoughts:</h4> Because URLs specifically show us results based on what
          webcrawlers can find, it is important to think about what content you
          are accessing and who is creating that content, and we know that
          countries such as America and England are dominating when it comes to
          content creation. This leads to techno-colonialsm, which is a term
          coined by Randy Bush in 2015 to describe the phenomenon of "the
          exploitation of poorer cultures by richer ones through technology". If
          technology is passed through a knowledge system, and the knowledge of
          technology requires a codification or verbalisation to be effectively
          used and understood, then what does that mean for those who do not
          have access to this knowledge? In the digital age, this gap between
          those who can and know how to use technology is emphasised. Job
          opportunites, health care systems, and other things which are solely
          based online cannot be used by a big portion of the world.
