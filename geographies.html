    <article class="h-entry">
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>
        This article surveys a range of contemporary information geographies to
        access patterns of mutability, mobility, and underlying power relations
        relative to historical arrangements in the production and use of
        information. It engages with the geographic distributions of access,
        participation, and representation.
      </p>
      <h4>Geographies of access and enablement</h4>
      <p>
        The statistics used for this were calculated by were using the internet
        penetration of a country (according to definitions and data from the
        World Bank). Geographies of access are important to understand because
        it provides insights into the distribution of technologies and services
        which are essential for digital communication, participation, and
        representation. Thus, this shows the patterns of (dis)connectivity.
      </p>
      <p>
        The results here show that Asia holds 42% of the worlds internet users
        (which is more than Europe and North America combined), and that all but
        four of the countries (Canada, New Zealand, Qatar and South Korea) with
        penetration rates greater than 80% are in Europe. The United States and
        Latin America have 40-60% penetration rates. However, more than 20
        sub-Saharan African countries have an internet penetration of less then
        20%, which means that most people on the planet still remain without
        internet access.
      </p>
      <h5>Broadband Affordability</h5>
      <p>
        The statistics used for this was based on mappings of the costs of fixed
        broadband subscription charges relative to the gross national income per
        capita, and was published by published by the International
        Telecommunication Union (ITU 2013).
      </p>
      <p>
        The results show that Europe and North America have high absolute costs
        but have some of the lowest relative costs in the world. Africa’s costs
        ranges between 10% and 250% of average income compared to North and
        South American and European users who can obtain internet connection for
        less than 10% of their income - distinction shared by only five
        sub-Saharan African countries. In 14 other sub-Saharan African countries
        as well Afghanistan and Tajikistan, the cost of internet connectivity is
        equal to 100% or more of the average salary.
      </p>
      <p>
        These statistics mean and show that there are countries which have
        extremely little internet users, which is seemingly correlating to the
        cost of internet connection (and perhaps device, infrastructure costs),
        and thus they are not able to participate in or contribute to
        representations of their localities.
      </p>
      <h4>Geographies of participation</h4>
      <p>
        This looks at statistic from three different variables: domain names,
        GitHub users and Wikipedia edits. These statistics are important because
        they represent who is making the content we are exposed to.
      </p>
      <h5>Geography of domain names</h5>
      <p>
        The data source here was the World Bank (2011), and it shows two types
        of domain names. Namely, generic Top-Level Domains (gTLDs) and country
        code Top-Level Domains (ccTLDs). The data assumes that ccTLDs are used
        and registered by the people in that country.
      </p>
      <p>
        The findings show that the majority of domains (78%) are registered in
        Europe or North America, in contrast Asia is home to only 13%. Globally,
        there are approximately 10 internet users for every registered domain.
        The United States has about one domain name for every three internet
        users, western Europe has five internet users per domain (but this
        varies from country to country), in contrast China has only one
        registered domain for every 40 internet users. In the Middle East and
        Africa this ratio is even smaller, with one domain per over 50 internet
        users.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is interesting to note here that a large amount of internet users
        does not translate into a high number of domain registrations.
      </p>
      <h5>Geography of GitHub users and commits</h5>
      <p>
        The data here comes from the GitHub archive (2015) and the World Bank
        and shows the number of GitHub users and commits by these users relative
        to the number of internet users in a country.
      </p>
      <p>
        North America and Europe each account for over one-third of the total
        number of GitHub users and the rate of participation, respectively 34
        and 21 GitHub users per 100 000 internet user, which contrasts with the
        global average of 11.4G per 100 K. Northern and Eastern Europe, Iceland
        and Sweden; each have more than 50G per 100 K as well as New Zealand and
        Australia with about 35G per 100 K. The remaining 17% of GitHub users
        are located in Asia (Singapore, Taiwan and China). The Middle East,
        North Africa and sub-Saharan Africa stand out with the lowest levels of
        participation and combined the regions are home to fewer than 1% of
        GitHub users and commits.
      </p>
      <p>
        This shows that this content creation is concentrated in Europe and
        North America.
      </p>
      <h5>Geography of Wikipedia contributions</h5>
      <p>
        The data here comes from the number of edits to every language version
        of Wikipedia coming from all countries and territory over a 2-year
        period (2010– 2011).
      </p>
      <p>
        There is once again a contrast here. Over a million edits each quarter
        come from users located in the United States, Germany, the United
        Kingdom and France. In contrast, only a few thousand edits per quarter
        are registered from most of Africa and the Middle East.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other data illustrates the percentage of edits about a country that
        come from users within that country. 85% and 78% of content about the
        United States and the United Kingdom comes from users located there, in
        contrast, only 16% of Nigerian content and 9% of Kenyan content is
        created by locals and in much of the rest of the continent less than 5%
        of content is generated locally.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of self-representation from African countries is scary and
        shows how little they are affecting their own representation to the
        world.
      </p>
      <p>
        The global North is characterised by the greatest levels of
        participation and is creating the bulk of digital content, while the
        global South contributes very little. Africa, in particular, is almost
        entirely omitted from these processes of digital generativity.
      </p>
      <h4>Geography of representation</h4>
      <p>
        This next part of the article is how countries are represented through
        applications such as Google Search, OpenStreetMap, and the Semantic Web
        as defined by and Geonames. Unsurprisingly, there was more information
        about the places in the global north than in other parts of the world.
        This leaves places such as North America and Europe to be
        over-represented and the rest of the world severely under-represented.
      </p>
      <h4>Analysis of findings/Own thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        What I find very interesting about this research paper is that it feels
        like “real” proof of the global north and of techno-colonialism in play.
        The people who contribute the most creations and participate in how they
        are created, are able to impose their ideals and representations onto
        others – whether intentionally or unknowingly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Techno-colonialism is an ongoing colonisation of the digital space.
        Techno-colonialism is a term coined by Randy Bush in 2015 and it
        describes “the exploitation of poorer cultures by richer ones through
        technology.” When the knowledge system of society is controlled by
        someone other than the locals, and their participation is intentionally
        taken away this becomes a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, during colonial rule, the colonial power controls the
        knowledge system of the society. This often meant the “intentional
        divestment of indigenous populations of power of participation” (Collier
        in Bristow, 2016). In techno-colonialism, this is primarily seen through
        the digital divide. The digital divide is a social issue referring to
        the differing amount of information between those who have access to the
        internet, and those who do not. This divide became particularly
        prominent during the information age in which information and
        communication technologies became the basis for economic and social
        connectivity. In other words, those who are able to be connected to the
        digital world, will always have more advantages than those who are
        unable to connect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without variation, technologies can be created with inherent biases of
        which the creators may not be aware. In Birhane et al. 2019 ‘Algorithmic
        Injustices: Towards a Relational Ethics’ we see how this may come to be.
        The tools we create are intrinsically tied to our nature of being and
        morality, but they also sustain moral order because it continuously
        perpetuates the creator’s biases. This static take on ethics which
        algorithms use, does not allow for the changes and development of
        society.
      </p>
      <p>
        In saying this, I think that when we design things, we must have some
        essentials: 1. A variety of creators/contributors 2. To create with
        intention and to be aware of our own biases 3. To ensure our creations
        can be shared by all
