      <h4>What is metadata?</h4>
      <p>
        “Metadata is simply data about data. It means it is a description and
        context of the data. It helps to organize, find and understand data”
        (Kononow, 2018). For example, when we look at a blog page, the URL,
        title, author and date all provide meatdata about the blog’s content.
      </p>
      <p></p>
      <h4>Types of metadata:</h4>
      <p>
        There are three main types of metadata: structural, administritive, and
        descrptitive. Structural metadata indicates how a digital assest is
        organised (eg. a table of contents), and more than this; structural
        metadata indicates the type of relationship between two assest. For
        exmaple, it could inidcate an edited photo versus an unedited one.
        Administritive metadata stores data about a digital asset.
        Administritive metadata can be broken up into three catagories (as per
        the National Information Standards Organization (NISO)), namely:
        technical, preservation and rights metadata. Descrptitive metadata helps
        us to discover and identify digital assests. In HTML, this would be at
        the beginning of the page and indicate things such asthe language of the
        website, what other scripts the page is linked to, etc. Thoughts: When
        it comes to making a website, metadata can become invaluable. Espeically
        descriptive data in HTML. Semantic elements and microformats are ways in
        which a designer could bring more traffic to their site. This is because
        webcrawlers search for key words when they recieve search requests,
        hence, if a designer uses as many relative keywords as possible, the
        webcrawler is more likely to suggest their site. Not only this, but
        having semantic rich HTML makes it easier for webreaders to go through
        your website - a big advantage for people with disabilities.
